### Hi ðŸ‘‹

After learning Excel VBA on my own, I've become passionate about development. 

With 5+ years of experience in software development, particularly in the financial sector and enterprise systems,Â I bring a strong foundation in scalable architecture, backend technologies, and systems integration.

I hold professional certifications from Oracle, as well as a post-graduate diploma in Software Architecture from University Infnet (2024) and a bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from University Center MaringÃ¡ (2020), which have provided me with a strong theoretical foundation to complement my practical experience. 

My expertise includes a blend of Java development and microservices architectures, using technologies such as Java, Spring Framework, C#, .Net Core, React, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, AWS S3, RabbitMQ, and Redis, but not limited to these only.
